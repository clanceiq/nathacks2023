Welcome to BabyExo! The UABiomed Club's submission in natHACKS 2023.
- BabyExo is a project intended to control an RC car through BCI. Its main purpose though is to be a proof of concept for a lower extremity exoskeleton the UABiomed Club is developing.

How does BabyExo work?
- BabyExo uses the Brainflow library to collect and filter EEG data gathered by our OpenBCI headset. It uses 4 channels, each channel connected to a different electrode to gather the data.
  
To run code:
  - Must be on Python 3.10
      - create/open a virtual environment
      - install all the libraries required
